          <p>When a user makes an aggregate lifetime total of deposits exceeding $100 or requests a withdrawal of any amount inside the RECASINO Platform, then it is compulsory for them to perform a full KYC process.

          During this process, the user will have to input some basic details about themselves and then upload
          A copy of Government Issued Photo ID (in some cases front and back depending on the doc)
          A selfie of themselves holding the ID doc
          A bank statement/Utility Bill
          Once uploaded, the user will get a “Temporarily Approved” Status and the documents will now be on our side, and the “KYC Team” will have 24hrs to go over them and email the user about the outcome:
          Approval
          Rejection
          More information needed – No change in Status
          When the user is on “Temporarily Approved” Status then
          They can use the platform normally
          They cannot deposit more than 500 USD in aggregate total
          They cannot complete any withdrawal.
          Guideline for the “KYC Process”

            Notes on the “KYC Process”
            When the KYC process is unsuccessful then the reason is documented and a support ticket is created in the system. The ticket number along with an explanation is communicated back to the user.
            Once all proper documents are in our possession then the account gets approved.
            “Other AML measures”
            If a user has not passed full KYC then they cannot make additional deposits or withdrawals of any amount.
            If a user has passed the KYC process successfully then
            There is a deposit limit per transaction (max 20,000 USD)
            Prior to any withdrawal there is a detailed algorithmic and manual check on the activity and balance of the user to see if the amount withdrawn is a result of proper activity in the platform.
            Under no circumstances may a user transfer funds directly to another user.
