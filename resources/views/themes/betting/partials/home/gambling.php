          <p><strong>Gambling addiction has no obvious physical signs or symptoms like there are in drug or alcohol addiction. Sometimes your friend, relative or even yourself might not be aware of what is happening. But, as with any other addiction, the hallmark sign of a gambling problem is that you feel you cannot stop. How can you spot the tendency in yourself or someone close to you?</strong></p>
          <p class="py-2">Common signs of addiction include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
          <p><strong>• Feeling the need to be secretive about your gambling. </strong></p>
          <p>You might gamble in secret or lie about how much you gamble, you might feel that others fail to understand you, or that you will surprise them with a big win.</p>
          <p><strong>• Having trouble controlling your gambling. </strong></p>
          <p>Once you start gambling, can you walk away? When you win – do you walk away or continue to play in hopes to win even more? If you loose, do you continue to play until the last coin, in hopes to win your losses back?</p>
          <p><strong>• Gambling when you cannot afford to.  </strong></p>
          <p>You may gamble until you’ve spent your last money, and then move on to funds you are not supposed to spend – to pay bills, credit cards, or budget for your children. You may feel compelled to borrow, sell, or even steal, to try your luck once more to win back your losses.</p>
          <p><strong>• Having family and friends worried about you.  </strong></p>
          <p>Denial keeps problem gambling going. If friends and family are worried, listen to them carefully. It’s not a sign of weakness to accept help. Many older gamblers are reluctant to reach out to their adult children if they’ve gambled away their inheritance, but it’s never too late to make changes for the better.</p><br>
          <p>If you think you may have a gambling problem, ask yourself whether you would feel okay to stop gambling right now. If you feel rather anxious, or as if you shouldn’t stop yet, chances are you might be suffering from a gambling addiction.</p>

          <p><strong>There are many online tests nowadays to help you to assess yourself. We have gathered only 7 questions, and if one of them you answer “Yes” to, we strongly advise to dig further and search for help.</strong></p>
          <p>• Have you ever gambled longer than planned?
              • Have you ever stolen time from work or school due to gambling?
              • After losing, have you ever felt you must return as soon as possible to win back your losses, or – after a win, have you ever felt a strong urge to return to win even more?
              • Have you ever bet more than you could afford to lose? Or have you often gambled until your last penny?
              • Have you borrowed money or sold anything in order to be able to gamble?
              • Have people criticised your betting habits or told you that you might have a gambling problem, whether or not you thought it was the case yourself?
              • Have you ever lied to your relatives, friends or people around you about how often you gamble and/or how much you have spent?

          <p><strong>There are always REASONS why people gamble. And this is the key to prevent and change the root cause of the habit.
            In one way or another, those reasons trigger the itching feeling to go and gamble. Are there alternatives to what you can do? There are – and you can choose one based on the trigger which you or your relative might have:
            </strong></p>
          <p><strong>• Solving money problems</strong></p>
          <p>Gambling companies are not there to make people rich and solve their financial problems. You must acknowledge this. The odds are always stacked against you, so it’s a far more effective way to seek financial aid in the form of loans from your local banks than illusively expect your next bet to land a big win and solve all the problems.
          </p>
          <p><strong>• Need for an excitement or rush of adrenaline</strong></p>
          <p>Go wild with a sport or a challenging hobby, such as mountain biking, rock climbing, or GoKart Racing.
          </p>
          <p><strong>• Lack of social life, because you are reserved or shy person</strong></p>
          <p>Spending time in online-gambling seems like fun, but instead create a hobby which will force you to go outdoors and engage in a group activity - join a social circle or a club, connect with family and friends, volunteer, find new friends.
          </p>
          <p><strong>• Avoiding or escaping thoughts about problems and/or painful feelings</strong></p>
          <p>Many people turn to addictions to escape or avoid their life problems. Divorce, for example, might make you willing to go and have a drink or play some slots just to forget about it. Instead, try therapy sessions, book an appointment with a psychologist or simply talk your problems through with close friends – let them help you.
          </p>
          <p><strong>• Boredom or loneliness</strong></p>
          <p>Find a hobby – something you’re passionate about, such as art, music, sports, or books. Nowadays there are plentiful means on social media to find individuals with similar interests. You do not have to be alone.
          </p>
          <p><strong>• Merely relaxing after a stressful day</strong></p>
          <p>From as little as 15 minutes of daily physical exercise relieves a lot of mental stress. Cycling or walking from work could be a good alternative if you cannot get yourself to the gym.
          </p>
          <p class="py-2">For a relative or a friend of a problem gambler</p>
          <p><strong>If there is a gambling problem in your home, don’t wait for the gambler to admit it.
            One of the crucial points for helping problem gamblers is to have the support and understanding of their family and friends. The last thing you would want them to think is that you are judging and confronting them. This will cause a detachment and might pull them even more towards gambling when they start feeling misunderstood, unwanted or pressured.
            </strong></p>
          <p class="py-2">As with any other addiction – you must accept and understand that the decision to quit gambling has to be their own. As much as you may want to, and as painful as it might be to watch your close ones going through addiction – you cannot forcefully make someone stop gambling. However, you can encourage them to seek help, support them in their efforts, protect yourself, and take any mentions of suicide seriously.
          </p>
          <p class="py-2">How can you do it? Seek help for yourself!
            This is extremely important to support oneself first, in order to be able to support others. You can learn about more effective ways of coping with the gambler and the gambling problem on a practical, day-to-day basis. You can learn techniques to enable you to deal with the extreme levels of stress this situation is creating. This may even motivate the gambler toward seeking help for him or herself.
